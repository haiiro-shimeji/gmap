<h2>Branches under the development.</h2>

<h3>7.x-2.x</h3>
<p>
This is synchronized 7.x-2.x branch in drupal.org, under the development for Googlemap API version 3 support. The following branches is based on this.
</p>

<h3>7.x-1.x-gv3</h3>
<p>
obsolete (merged to 7.x-2.x
</p>

<h3>original_marker</h3>
<p>
Different marker images for the various taxonomies is supported by Gmap module (but it seems to be not working.. Definition of an image for each taxonomies is supported by Taxonomy image module, I think it is better to unify marker images in map and taxonomy images in the other component, for easily understanding. The goal for this branch is to display images defined by Taxonomy image module on the map.
</p>

<h3>ajax-view</h3>
<p>
To manage a huge number of location data, it is not enough the current system. The Exposed filter and limitation of the number of displaying marker helps this, but prevents the searchability. The goal for this branch is to get markers only in bounds now-displaying, and ajax-reload markers triggered pan or zoom actions.
